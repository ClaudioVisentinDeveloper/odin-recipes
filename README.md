# Welcome to my first HTML project!

## Project Summmary

This is my first HTML project following the Odin Project course.
Here you will find a website containing a few recipes.
With this project, I intend to demonstrate my grasp on basic HTML language.

## Post Submission Thoughts

I feel that it is quite amazing that I was able to write a simple website after just two days of learning.
So far it feels pretty barebones, but I am excited to see where this course will lead me.
Maybe I will come back to this website to see what I will be able to apply after a few more lessons!
